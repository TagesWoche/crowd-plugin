TalkToMe lets you create and add cards to your contents for polls or similar community input.

== Description ==

= WHAT IS IT? =

A plugin that lets you gather user input directly from your WordPress community.

= WHY USE IT? =

Out of the box, WordPress has only one way to gather user input: comments. If you wan't to interact more thoroughly with your community, comments are not enough. Therefore, we created this plugin.

= WHAT DOES THE PLUGIN DO? =

You can create a so called ‘Input Card’ where users can answer a question and provide valuable feedback. Furthermore, the plugin provides a ‘Poll Card’ that you can use for surveys. Finally, there is also a third type of cards ‘HTML Card’ that allows custom html input to create your very own card.

= HOW DO I USE IT? =

Once the plugin is activated, navigate to ‘Crowd’ and then click on Cards. Here you can create a New Card and choose the type of card you are interested in.
After creating your card, you are able to attach the cards to your WordPress post.

1. Upload `crowd.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
